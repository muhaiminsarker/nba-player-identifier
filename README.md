### NBA Player Identifier
#### Description
The main idea behind this is to identify who NBA Players are by uploading an image of that player. On the consumer/user end, they would upload a picture of the NBA player and then it would return who the NBA player is. If the person did not upload a picture of an NBA player, then it would return "This is not an NBA Player". Primarily, I will focus on players from 2000-2022 right now and then diversify into the older NBA player generations. 

#### Steps 
1. Use Selenium and Beautiful Soup to web scrape different websites to obtain a dataset of NBA players
2. Use a database like Kaggle that has many images of NBA players or obtain images from Google programmatically
3. Use Machine Learning or OpenCV to predict NBA players based on the image provided 

#### Structuring the Information
1. Show more information about the players or their biography
2. Template: https://kprofiles.com/stray-kids-members-profile-facts/ (how to showcase it). A suggestion from my sister who is an avid Stray Kids fan
